JPA is the industry-standard specification for managing relational data in Java applications. It defines a set of interfaces and annotations that outline how Java objects should be mapped to database tables and how persistence operations (like saving or retrieving data) should be performed. It provides the contract for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) without offering an implementation.

Hibernate is a widely adopted, robust ORM framework that provides a concrete implementation of the JPA specification. It handles the actual work of translating Java object operations into database-specific SQL commands and vice-versa. When we use JPA, we are often using Hibernate (or another JPA provider) behind the scenes to execute those persistence instructions.

Spring Data JPA is a Spring project that provides a higher-level abstraction over JPA providers like Hibernate. It significantly reduces boilerplate code for data access layers by automatically generating repository implementations based on interface definitions. It integrates seamlessly with Spring's dependency injection and transaction management, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than intricate persistence details. It doesn't implement JPA itself but leverages existing JPA implementations to simplify data access.
