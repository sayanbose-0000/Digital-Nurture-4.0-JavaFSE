1 a. Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.

Sol:
- Big O notation denotes the worst case time or space complexity of an algorithm
- Denotes how the time/space req grows with increase in n (size) of elements stored





1 b. Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.

Sol:
- There are mainly two types of search operations:
    - Linear Search
    - Binary Search

- For linear search- The time compexity in worst and average case is O(n), and for best case is O(1). Space complexiy is O(1)
- For binary search- The time complexity in worst and average case if O(n), and for best case is O(1) (sorted). For iterative approach, space complexity is O(1)






4 a.
- For linear search- The time compexity in worst and average case is O(n), and for best case is O(1).
- For binary search- The time complexity in worst and average case if O(n), and for best case is O(1) (sorted).
- For out platform, binary search is more suitable because if our company grows, and db becomes large, binary search will be more efficient as it has a lower time compexity
