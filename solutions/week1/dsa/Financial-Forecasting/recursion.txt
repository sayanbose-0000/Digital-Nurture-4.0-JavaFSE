1 a. Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.

Sol:
- Recursion is the process in which a method calls itself to solve a problem
- Used when some operation repeats itself multiple times


4 a. Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.

Sol:
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n)

4 b. Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
Sol:
- This recursion can be improved through memoization (storing repetitive calculations)
